= Unlimited number of product feeds =
No limitations on the number of product feeds.

= Filter rules =
Set advanced filter ruling per channel so only your most profitable products make it to the product feed. For example: exclude low-margin products, exclude products that are low on stock or only include products that are on sale. You name it, any filter is possible!

= Field / attribute selection =
Determine yourself what attributes to in- or exclude in your product feed. Rule-of-thumb: the more attributes you put in, the better change you have of getting good listings on the channels of your choice.

Map your field attributes to those of the channels of your choice. For many channels using the right field names is obliged.

= Category / taxonomy mapping =
Some marketing channels require you to map your categories to theirs (such as Google Shopping). This plugin enables you to exactly do that. Not only does it support 1-to-1 category mapping but you can also map subsets of products on a channel-category based on product names.

This plugin enables you to add and configure Google Analytics UTM tracking-codes to your product URL’s so you can measure the effectiveness of your marketing channels in Google Analytics. 

= Shipping class support =
This plugin enables you to set the shipping zone (and shipping class) so the right shipping cost end up in your product feed.

This plugin supports product variations so all your variations make it to product feeds as individual products too.
